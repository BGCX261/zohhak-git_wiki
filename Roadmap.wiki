There is no official roadmap. It all depends on community's feedback. The most likely TODOs:
 * support for custom annotations. that will further reduce amount of boilerplate code
 * support for other runners: spring, mockito, maybe powermock, maybe junit < 4.5
 * rewrite runner to make it easy to extend and combine with other runners
 * add a lot of default coercions (classes, big decimals, dates, yoda etc.)
 * add 'transitive' coercions. it would be nice to allow to write coercion to joda from date, not only from string
 * add 'partial' coercion. It would be nice to allow to write sth like <2.3, 3.5i> and then write coercion to complex number from two doubles instead of from one string. But this one is just an idea, i still have no clear concept for it

If you have other ideas, share them.
