#summary Key concepts of Zohhak

= Introduction =

Each zohhak's test method contains string parameters provided within annotation. Each of them represents a single test method execution.
{{{
@TestWith({
    "clerk,      45'000 USD, GOLD",
    "supervisor, 60'000 GBP, PLATINUM"
})
public void canAcceptDebit(Employee employee, Money money, ClientType clientType) {
    ...
}
}}}
Zohhak:
  # takes each string (e.g. "clerk, 45'000 USD, GOLD")
  # splits it (if necessary) to produce required number of parameters (e.g. "clerk", "45'000 USD", "GOLD")
  # coerces each string to the corresponding method's parameter (e.g. Employee, Money, ClientType)
  # executes method with produced parameters

Many aspects of splitting and coercing can be configured. Zohhak uses it's default configuration which can be overridden with class and method level configurations. More specific configuration overrides more general one (similar to css).
